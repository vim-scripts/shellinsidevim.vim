 --Typing the Ex command "Shell" will also allow you to run a Shell which you
   give and pass up to 20 parameters to that shell.

   Sample syntax...
       :Shell ps -e

 --Pressing "F4" will toggle the display of a buffer containing the output
   produced when running the shell command.

 **************************Some special syntax format**************************

 --If a Shell command starts with ":", this Shell will be executed as a vim Ex
  command, this is convenience if you map this command to a shortcut such as:

  map <CR> :Shell

  Then you could use this script to execute all the normal command directly.

  --If a Shell command starts with ">", this Shell will be executed with inputs
  which come from a file, which name is ".VIM_STD_IN". If the input file dose
 not exsits, you could give the inputs line by line by typing directly.

  --If a Shell command ends with ";", this Shell will be executed as a program
  development tool. You could use this script for your development, then you 
  could pass the compile or interpret command as the Shell parameters with ";"
  followed. When the command finished it will jump to the first error line if
  there are some errors. Of caurse you should special a compiler first.
